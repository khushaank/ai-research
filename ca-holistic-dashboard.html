    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page interactive dashboard designed for self-assessment and actionable guidance. The core of the application is a radar chart that visualizes the user's self-rated balance across six key life areas they feel are missing from their online CA preparation. This provides immediate, personalized visual feedback. Below this assessment tool, a dynamic "Action Plan" section offers tailored, practical solutions for each area, which are revealed on-demand by clicking on the corresponding category. This structure was chosen to first engage the user with a personal assessment ('the problem') and then provide clear, focused solutions ('what to do'), preventing information overload and promoting a proactive, step-by-step user flow. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: User's self-assessment across 6 life areas (Peer Network, Extracurricular, etc.). Goal: Compare personal standing in multiple areas simultaneously. Viz/Presentation Method: Radar Chart (Chart.js on a Canvas element). Interaction: The user adjusts sliders (1-10) for each area, and the radar chart updates in real-time. Justification: A radar chart is the ideal tool for comparing multiple variables against a central point, providing an instant "shape" of one's life balance. The real-time updates make it a highly personal and engaging diagnostic tool.
        - Report Info: The six categories of missed experiences. Goal: Organize and inform. Viz/Presentation Method: Thematic cards (structured HTML with Tailwind CSS). Interaction: Each card contains a description and a button to reveal actionable solutions. Justification: Cards effectively modularize the information, making it easy for the user to digest each concept individually before diving into solutions.
        - Report Info: The user's need for actionable advice to compensate for the lack of college experience. Goal: Provide clear, targeted solutions. Viz/Presentation Method: A dynamically updated text block (HTML populated by JavaScript). Interaction: Clicking a button on any of the six category cards populates this section with specific, relevant advice. Justification: This on-demand approach avoids overwhelming the user with a long wall of text and allows them to focus on improving one area at a time.
        - Library/Method: Chart.js for the radar chart, Vanilla JS for state management and DOM manipulation, Tailwind CSS for styling.
